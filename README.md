# Hypergaph Based Analysis of ERC 721 Token Transactions
Leveraging a comprehensive dataset from X-Block ETH,
this analysis explores the dynamics of token transfers and wallet relationships. 
Traditional graph methods, while useful, often fail to capture complex interactions and temporal variations within the data. 
In contrast, the hypergraph model provides deeper insights into token transaction networks, uncovering unique patterns and enhancing the understanding of wallet interactions. 
This approach effectively represents multifaceted relationships where multiple wallets interact with a single token or vice versa, surpassing the limitations of pairwise connections. 
Additionally, by incorporating temporal data, the hypergraph model reveals how wallet interactions evolve over time.
